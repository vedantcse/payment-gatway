A demo of Razorpay Node Sdk with React.js showcasing the payments and refunds scenarios: 

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashwamegh/razorpay-react-demo.git
cd razorpay-react-demo
```

## Prerequisites

> Get your Razorpay API keys [`key_id` and `key_secret`] for test environment variables from here, [https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/app/keys](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/app/keys)

## Installation

### For Frontend

> Note: make sure you have added Razorpay script `<script src="https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/checkout.js"></script>` in your HTML file to get the Razorpay constructor reference. For Eg: To access it using `window.Razorpay` or `Razorpay`

```bash
npm install or yarn
touch .env
```

Copy the contents from `sample.env` to `.env` and replace the dumb characters(`xxxxx`) with your Razorpay `key` and the Server URL, which you will be creating soon(local default is already there in the file).

```bash
npm start or yarn start
```



### For Backend/Server 
> Note:  Server Needed to talk with Razorpay using Node SDK

```bash
cd server
npm install or yarn
touch .env
```
Copy the contents from `sample.env` to `.env` and replace the dumb characters(`xxxxx`) with your Razorpay `key` and `secret`

Now run,
```bash
npm start or yarn start
```

You can goto http://localhost:8080 and try out this demo, later you can deploy the server code to server app containers like **heroku, glitch, aws, etc** and replace the URL in frontend's `.env` file with your new server URL.
